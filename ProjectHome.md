Archimetrix combines clustering-based architecture reconstruction and pattern detection techniques to recover the architecture of a software system from source code. While the clustering extracts a software architecture based on source code metrics, the pattern detection is used to detect design deficiencies in the architecture which influence the architecture reconstruction negatively. Archimetrix supports the reengineer by identifying components that are especially relevant for the detection of design deficiencies. It also ranks the detected deficiencies so the reengineer can focus on the important problems. Once the deficiencies are removed, the clustering can be used again to get a clearer view of the now improved software architecture.
