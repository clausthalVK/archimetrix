<h1>How To Start</h1>

<p>To perform the reengineering process as performed in [Pla11], Chapter 3, 
you have to execute the following steps.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a GAST of the system under analysis with SISSy:</p>
	<p> First, a generalized abstract syntax tree (GAST) of the system under analysis has to be created.
	For this, the parser SISSy can be used.
	A documentation for SISSy is available under <a href=http://www.sqools.org/sissy>http://www.sqools.org/sissy</a>.
	</p></li>
<li><p>Execute a Clustering with SoMoX</p>
	<p> In the next step, SoMoX is used to cluster the system. 
	A documentation for SoMoX is available under <a href=http://www.sqools.org/somox>http://www.sqools.org/somox</a>.
	</p></li>
<li><p>Perform a Component Relevance Analysis</p>
	<p> The component relevance analysis can be started via the menu bar: <b>Archimetrix -> Reengineering of Design Deficiencies -> Find Relevant Components</b>.
	The opened wizard requires the source code decorator model from the clustering (*.sourcecodedecorator) and the metric values model (*.ecore) as input. 
	Both files were created during the initial clustering. 
	Using the default settings, they are both saved in a folder ``model" in the surrounding project folder.
	
	Depending on the size of the system under analysis, the component relevance analysis takes some time to load the required model elements.
	After that, the <em>Relevant Component View</em> opens.
	</p></li>
<li><p>Start the Bad Smell Detection</p>
	<p> The bad smell detection on a set of selected components can be started via the menu bar: <b>Reclipse EMF -> Start Pattern Based Architecture Analysis</b>.
	
	Another possibility to start the bad smell detection on a selected component is via the context menu in the Relevant Components View.
	
	When the bad smell detection is finished, the detected bad smell occurrences are listed in the view <em>Annotations</em>.
	This view provides buttons for loading and saving the detection results into a file. 
	To execute a bad smell relevance analysis, the detected bad smells have to be saved.
	</p></li>
<li><p>Perform a Bad Smell Relevance Analysis</p>
	<p>The bad smell relevance analysis can be started via the menu bar: <b>Archimetrix -> Reengineering of Design Deficiencies -> Find Relevant Bad Smells</b>.
	The opened wizard requires the file with the saved bad smell occurrences (*.psa) and the metric values model as input.
	
	Here again, depending on the size of the system under analysis, the bad smell relevance analysis takes some time to load the required model elements.
	After that, the <em>Relevant Bad Smells View</em> opens.
	</p></li>
<li><p>Execute an Architecture Prognosis</p>
	<p> The architecture prognosis can be started via the menu bar (<b>Archimetrix -> Reengineering of Design Deficiencies -> View Architecture Prognosis</b>) or via the context menu for a bad smell occurrence in the Relevant Bad Smells View.
	
	The Architecture Prognosis Wizard takes the metric values model, the detected bad smell occurrences and a file with reengineering strategies as input (*.ecore) as input. 
	On the second wizard page, the bad smell occurrence to be removed has to be selected and
	on the third page, the reengineering strategy for which the prognosis shall be executed, has to be selected.
	
	After having finished the wizard, the <em>Architecture Prognosis View</em> shows the prognosis results.
	
	To perform the next iteration of the reengineering process the clustering results achieved in the architecture prognosis can be used as input for the bad smell detection.
	</p></li>
