<h1>Component Relevance Analysis</h1>

<p> The component relevance analysis can be started via the menu bar: <b>Archimetrix -> Reengineering of Design Deficiencies -> Find Relevant Components</b>.
	The opened wizard requires the source code decorator model from the clustering (*.sourcecodedecorator) and the metric values model (*.ecore) as input. 
	Both files were created during the initial clustering. 
	Using the default settings, they are both saved in a folder ``model" in the surrounding project folder.
	
	Depending on the size of the system under analysis, the component relevance analysis takes some time to load the required model elements.
	After that, the <em>Relevant Component View</em> opens.
	</p>

<h2> The Relevant Components View</h2>
<p> The Relevant Components View shows the analysis results in tabular form.
Each line presents one component. The column <em>Component</em> shows the classes the
component consists of. The second and third columns <em>Closeness To Threshold</em>
and <em>Complexity (CPC)</em> show the values of the two relevance strategies (see [Pla11], Section 4.1.3).
The <em>Relevance Total</em> column shows the normalized vector length and the column
<em>Pareto Optimality</em> tells if the candidate is pareto optimal, as described in
[Pla11], Section 4.1.4. Pareto optimal candidates are highlighted with a yellow background
in the whole line. If the candidate with the highest vector length is not pareto optimal, the Relevance Total fied for this
candidate is highlighted as well.</p>
