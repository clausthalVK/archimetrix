<h1>Architecture Prognosis</h1>

<p> The architecture prognosis can be started via the menu bar (<b>Archimetrix -> Reengineering of Design Deficiencies -> View Architecture Prognosis</b>) or via the context menu for a bad smell occurrence in the Relevant Bad Smells View.
	
	The Architecture Prognosis Wizard takes the metric values model, the detected bad smell occurrences and a file with reengineering strategies as input (*.ecore) as input. 
	On the second wizard page, the bad smell occurrence to be removed has to be selected and
	on the third page, the reengineering strategy for which the prognosis shall be executed, has to be selected.
	
	After having finished the wizard, the <em>Architecture Prognosis View</em> shows the prognosis results.
	
	To perform the next iteration of the reengineering process the clustering results achieved in the architecture prognosis can be used as input for the bad smell detection.

<h2>The Architecture Prognosis View </h2>
<p>The Architecture Prognosis View presents the results from the architecture prognosis in
form of a comparison between original architecture and predicted architecture.
On the top part of the view, a table juxtaposes the original architecture to the
predicted architecture. The lines of this table show the total number of components,
the number of primitive components, the number of composite components,
the number of interfaces and the number of messages for each architecture.
Below the table, the elements of the both architectures are shown by two tree
viewers: the original architecture on the left, the predicted architecture on the
right. In the first lines only the top level elements are shown: the components.
Primitive and composite components can be distinguished by different icons and
by the name of the component. For primitive components, a label between the
component name shows how many classes it consist of. For composite components,
the number of sub components is presented in this label. The lines can be
expanded so that the implementing classes or sub components can be inspected.
To simplify the comparison of the architectures, lines that differ are highlighted
with a yellow background. Components that are missing in the predicted architecture
are highlighted with a red background on the original architecture side,
while components that are new in the predicted architecture are highlighted with
a green background on the predicted architecture side.</p>
