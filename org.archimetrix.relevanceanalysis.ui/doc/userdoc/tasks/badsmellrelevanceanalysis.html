<h1>Bad Smell Relevance Analysis</h1>

<p>The bad smell relevance analysis can be started via the menu bar: <b>Archimetrix -> Reengineering of Design Deficiencies -> Find Relevant Bad Smells</b>.
	The opened wizard requires the file with the saved bad smell occurrences (*.psa) and the metric values model as input.
	
	Here again, depending on the size of the system under analysis, the bad smell relevance analysis takes some time to load the required model elements.
	After that, the <em>Relevant Bad Smells View</em> opens.
	</p>

<h2>The Relevant Bad Smells View</h2>
<p>The Relevant Bad Smells View shows the analysis results in tabular form.
Each line presents one bad smell occurrence. 
The first column <em>Bad Smell</em> shows the name of the bad smell specification.
The second column <em>Roles</em> shows the roles of the pattern specification and the names of the objects that play theses roles in the concrete pattern candidate.
The next columns show the relevance values for the different strategies that were explained in [Pla11] in Section 4.2.3:
<em>Relevance CL</em> presents the value for the relevance strategy <em>Class Locations</em>; 
<em>Relevance NEA</em> shows the value for the relevance strategy <em>NumberOfExternalAccesses</em>;
the value for the <em>Higher Interface Adherence</em> relevance strategy is presented in the column <em>Relevance HIA</em>;
<em>Relevance DCC</em> shows the value for the <em>Communication via Data Classes</em> relevance strategy.
The last two columns are the same as in the Relevant Components View.
They show the overall relevance and if a candidate is pareto optimal.
Pareto optimal candidates are highlighted as well as the candidate with the highest overall relevance.
