This page covers the extension of Archimetrix and explains a few details about its inner workings.



# Extension of the Component Relevance Analysis #

## Creation of new relevance strategies ##
The relevance analysis is extensible with new relevance strategies. new strategies have to implement the interface `org.archimetrix.relevanceanalysis.components.IComponentsStrategy`. At the moment, the initialization of all available strategies is hard-coded in the class `org.archimetrix.relevanceanalysis.components.RelevantComponentAnalysis`. This should probably be refactored into an extension point mechanism.

## Configuration of the Closeness To Threshold strategy ##
This strategy identifies components whose merge or composition value was close to the respective threshold during the architecture reconstruction (see Section 6.5.2 in [this thesis](http://digital.ub.uni-paderborn.de/ubpb/urn/urn:nbn:de:hbz:466:2-10973)). The user can configure how close a value may be to the threshold to be regarded as significant. This configuration can be performed in the file `config/config.properties` in the plug-in `org.archimetrix.relevanceanalysis`. The default value is 0.1.

# Design Deficiency Detection #

The following activity describes the general process of the design deficiency detection in Archimetrix. Only the parts that are specific for Archimetrix are described here. The description of the pattern detection in Reclipse can be found [here](ReclipsePatternDetection.md).

## Modification of detection engines ##

In order to confine the deficiency detection to the user-selected components, the deficiency patterns are modified before the story diagrams are generated. The modification step is realized in the class `org.reclipse.structure.inference.extended.CatalogModifyingGenerateEnginesStrategy`. First, a constraint is built from the ids of the selected components: _id == selectedComponent1.id | ... | selectedComponentN.id_. This constraint is then added to the two auxiliary pattern _DirectComponentClasses_ and _IndirectComponentClasses_. These two patterns represent the membership of classes in components (directly or indirectly, respectively). By adding the id constraint to these patterns, it is ensured that they can only be detected for the user-selected components. Because the deficiency patterns all state something about deficiencies on the component level, they are all using the two auxiliary patterns (or the abstract _Component_ pattern which is extended by _DirectComponentClasses_ and _IndirectComponentClasses_). Therefore, the deficiency patterns too can only be detected for the selected components.

In order to ensure that the modification happens and that the story diagrams are generated from the modified patterns, Archimetrix (or more precisely, the two wizards `StartModifyingCatalogWizard` and `StartPatternDetectionForComponentWizard`) configures the `PrepareDetectionEnginesJob` with the `CatalogModifyingGenerateEnginesStrategy`.

# Extension of the Deficiency Ranking #

Similar to the Component Relevance Analysis, the Deficiency Ranking can be extended. In order to add new ranking strategies, a new class that extends `org.archimetrix.relevanceanalysis.badsmells.strategies.BadSmellsRelevanceStrategy` has to be created. Because ranking strategies may only be applicable to certain deficiencies, the method `applicable` has to be overwritten (see `ClassLocationsStrategy` for an example).
