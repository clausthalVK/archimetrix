This project helps to transform story diagrams created with the editor from storydriven.org into the input that Archimetrix expects.
More precisely, an ecore file that contains a package and a class is created and single story diagrams are added to operations of this class.
Furthermore, the required parameters and parameter expressions are created.
Use config.properties to configure this process.

This project will not be needed anymore if another story diagram editor is used that is able to create an adequate input for Archimetrix.
